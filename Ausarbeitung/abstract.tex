\begin{abstract}
Automated verification of programs is an important part of software engineering.
The verification of multiply linked data-structures however is a serious challenging
task since these Structures can be of unbound size. We investigate this problem with the use
of monotonic abstraction backward reachability analysis.\\
We use vertex- and edge-labeled graphs to represent heaps and introduce signatures, which are predicates that
define sets of heaps, to check properties of the heap such as absence of null pointers. In addition, we show the results
of a Java prototype which implements this approach.

	Write a short abstract. Do not give to much details here, but
	arouse the readers interest. A nice opportunity to comment the 
	text is given by the following:
	%\Author{This is a comment of the
	%author (you).} \Supervisor{This is a comment
	%of the supervisor.} 
	Especially if you write in german, you sometimes need to specify
	the hyphenation, as e.g. for the word 
	thisisaverylongwordwhosehyphanationmustbedefined.
