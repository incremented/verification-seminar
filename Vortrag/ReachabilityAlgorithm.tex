    \begin{itemize}
        \item <2-> Backwards Analysis from set of bad configurations $S_{bad}$
        \item <3-> Compute predecessors for every $s \in S_{bad}$
        \item <4-> If a predecessor $p$ is computed with $s' \sqsubseteq p$, where $s'$ is a previously calculated signature, discard $p$
        \item <5-> Repeat until all new computed predecessors are being discarded
        \item <6-> If the set of signatures is disjoint from the initial set of states\\
         $\Rightarrow$ program execution is safe
